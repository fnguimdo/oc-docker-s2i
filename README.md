# Deploying OpenShift application from Dockerfile using S2I capability
## Introduction
OpenShift Source-to-Image (S2I) is a framework that makes it easy to write images that take application source code as an input and produce a new image that runs the assembled application as output. The main advantage of using S2I for building reproducible Docker images is the ease of use for developers. A Dockerfile is a recipe (or blueprint) for building Docker images.<br>
In this tutorial, you will learn how to use OpenShift S2I feature to build a docker image from a Dockerfile hosted in github and deploy a Pod using that docker image. You will also learn how to setup the github webhook to notify OpenShift of new code push/commit events in github, such that OpenShift will auto rebuild and redeploy Pods using the latest code/Dockerfile changes in your github.
